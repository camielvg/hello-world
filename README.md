There are 6 possible components available via their methods:
- `getFirstPage()`: to get data of the first page. There's always a first page available.
- `getPrevPage()`: to get the previous page. Previous is not available on the first page, because a previous page doesn't exist. 
- getCurrentPage(): to get data of the current page. Always available.

## Installation

Install with composer:

```
composer require "camielvg/hello-world:1.0.*"

Or by adding it to your composer.json file:
